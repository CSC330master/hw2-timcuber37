3. Collaboration/External Resources
	Students are encouraged to work in pairs unless specified and will both recieve the same grade if they choose to do so. Any online/printed external resources may be used except Generative AI. Read + 
understand material before using in your own work. Discussion with other students is permitted but working with students outside your group is not. Topics not covered in class can be used but students should
be ready to explain solutions. Collaboration Report must be submitted with all homeworks. 

Late assignments have a 10% penalty per day. Missing class counts against your participation grade. Exit tickets are important for participation.
